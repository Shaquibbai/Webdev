***Web 2.0 (Social or Interactive Web)

*Moving into the 2000s, web 2.0 marked the shift to a more interactive and collaborative internet, where users could create, share, and engage with content. It introduced dynamic websites, social media platforms, blogs, and user-generated content, emphasizing participation, connectivity, and the rise of communities online.

***Web 3.0 (Semantic Web)

*By the 2010s, web 3.0, often called the "semantic web," focuses on decentralization, AI-driven personalization, and improved data interoperability.
